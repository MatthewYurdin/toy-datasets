# Matt's Toy Datasets

I plan to use these for tests, small experiments, and my own entertainment. The datasets are:

- Summary data from Mosteller and Youtz, "Quantifying Probabilistic Expressions" (1990) in *Statistical Science* Vol. 6, No. 1. These results come from a survey of 238 science writers, who were asked what numeric probability corresponds to expressions like *Very possible*, *Almost always*, *Usually*, etc.

- Summary data from a 2008 quasi-experimental study of the effect of student loan debt on post-baccalaureate enrollment. This was based on the experience of around 45,000 students who graduated from the same large, state university system between 2001-02 and 2003-04.

- Detailed data covering all American hospitals located in large metropolitan areas. This includes data about the hospitals as well as about the metropolitan areas. It was originally intended to be used to train, and compare the performance of, several predictive model types.

- A block-level sample of property tax records for individual homes in the Spruce Hill neighborhood of West Philadephia.

- Institution-level data for American colleges & universities mainly concerning degrees awarded in various fields. This dataset was made for determining how well *new academic programs* can be identified based on the limited information schools report to [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds).

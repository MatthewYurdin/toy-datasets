# Matt's Toy Datasets

I plan to use these for tests, small experiments, and my own entertainment. The datasets are:

- Summary data from Mosteller and Youtz, "Quantifying Probabilistic Expressions" (1990) in *Statistical Science* Vol. 6, No. 1. These results come from a survey of 238 science writers, who were asked what numeric probability corresponds to expressions like *Very possible*, *Almost always*, *Usually*, etc.
